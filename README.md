#### API Rate Limit : 1.5 requests/second

### Submission Notes
A data join on all three api endpoints was conducted in order to get meaningful data for the Geo Visualization. 1) Each data point was programmatically assigned to a point of interest (POI)
2) A summation of all metrics for a given POI over the entire given time period was then performed in order to map the data.
3) A heatmap layer has been integrated into the map to demonstrate the relative intensity of a metric as it's selected from the drop down menu.

Google Maps API key has been restricted to the above hosted site. If local deployment of app is needed please contact me to temporarily lift restrictions.
